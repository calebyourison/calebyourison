## About Me
---
My name is Caleb Yourison. 
I've spent the majority of my career in the security industry, though I have always enjoyed networking and programming as a hobby.  
As the security industry has changed rapidly over the years, cyber security and high level integration have become key components instead of mere afterthoughts.  
Often devising solutions requires generating new ideas, or building upon the ideas of others.  
I endeavor to that end.
